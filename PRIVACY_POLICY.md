Welcome to the AutoLeaveMeet for Chrome Extension!

This is an open source chrome extension developed by Tan Jun Yan. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the extension is also available on chrome web store.

As an avid chrome extension user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

Therefore, I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (google meets link, threshold) created by the you is stored on your chrome local storage only, and can be simply erased by clearing your chrome's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Tan Jun Yan.
